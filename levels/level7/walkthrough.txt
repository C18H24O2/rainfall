In this level, we have a structure "t_list", being a chained list.
four t_list are being declared, first having second as his next element
and third having fourth as his next element.
argv[1] and 2 are being copied into first->next and third->next (being second and fourth)
we can overflow outside of the malloced space to edit the got and replace
it with another address.
The default behavior of the program is putting the flag in the "c" global string, or crashing if we don't give it at least 2 argv.
