In this level, we will exploit the printf() command to modify the value
of the global int "m" by putting a payload in the buffer string :
The payload consist of :
- The address of the global
- We put the %p flag of printf to jump the first 3 arguments so that the address of m comes first
- We then put padding to have a total value of 64
- We then use the %n flag so that the value is set to the address of m
